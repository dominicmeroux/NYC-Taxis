# ChicagoTaxi-DailyMileage

**Goal**: Using the full Chicago taxi dataset, obtain the daily driving range of individual taxis. This is useful for assessing how much electric battery range would be needed to support a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) or fully electric (BEV) taxi fleet. Note that the key missing piece of information is the amount of mileage spent traveling in between fare rides (e.g. driving from a suburb to a different location in Chicago with greater known demand). 

# GoogleMapsAPI-TravelTimes

**Goal**: Using a sample of NYC Taxi trips, query the Google Maps API to obtain travel times using 'driving', 'transit', 'cycling', and 'walking' modes. 

# Taxi-Cost-Analysis

**Goal**: Analysis of per-mile cost data in the NYC Yellow Cab and Chicago taxi trip data

# Taxi-Graph-Analysis

**Goal**: Analysis of network characteristics of the NYC Yellow Cab and Chicago taxi trip data

# Taxi-Powertrain-Analysis

**Goal**: This Python program uses PySpark to assess the proportion of New York City taxicabs that have a hybrid powertrain compared with the proportion that have other powertrains.
